Preincident Planning with Geopaparazzi

Geopaparazzi ( http://geopaparazzi.github.io/geopaparazzi/ ) is an Android app that was 'developed to do very fast qualitative engineering/geologic surveys.'  It looks like a great tool to use for pre-incident planning purposes for fire departments.

This is an attempt at making a custom form for Geopaparazzi to collect information for Adams Township Vol. Fire Department.

Notes:
On my Android phone, I had to turn on Developer options -> USB debugging in order to view files on my Windows 7 machine as a media device (MTP).

I also found it helpful to Force Stop the application before copying the tags.json file back to the phone.
